Currently there is computer science with the intention of gaining knowledge in more STEM related subjects.","sidebar":"subjectSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-1":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-1","title":"Introduction to Computation","description":"Computers are powerful tools that have allowed us to do things that were previously impossible but they can only do what we tell them to do. There are two types of knowledge, declarative and imperative. Declarative knowledge is a statement of facts like square root of a number x is y such that y \\\\* y = x. However a computer cannot understand this statement, it can only understand instructions (how-to) which is called imperative knowledge. You can give a computer a list of instructions to find the square root of a number, it will not understand the results but it will be able to find the square root of a number with the right instructions.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-10":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-10","title":"Searching and Sorting","description":"There are many times one needs to sort collections and search them as well. The collections we may run these algorithms on may be huge and we need to make sure we pick efficient solution to problems.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-2":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-2","title":"Branching and Iteration","description":"A computer executes a program line by line from top to bottom. However, there are times when we want to execute a block of code multiple times or skip a block of code. This is where branching and iteration come in.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-3":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-3","title":"Strings and Algorithms","description":"Some ways we have worked with strings include concatenation and repeating strings using multiplication. There are other ways to work with strings that we will explore in this section because being able to work with strings is a very important skill for a programmer.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-4":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-4","title":"Functions","description":"As programs get larger, they become more difficult to understand and maintain. In computer science, we take two approaches to break down complex programs into smaller, more manageable pieces.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-5":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-5","title":"Tuples and Lists","description":"Typically we want to hold more than one data in a variable like a sequence of numbers or names. To be able to do that we need to use tuples or lists. Both hold a sequence of data but they treat the data differently.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-6":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-6","title":"Recursion and Dictionaries","description":"Looping with for loops and while loops are iterative however, there are other ways to repeat items which could end up simplifying code even further. We call this other method recursion. Our lists and tuples are great ways to store large amounts of data however there are also more flexible options like dictionaries which may be better for some use cases.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-7":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-7","title":"Debugging and Testing","description":"As programs get complicated, we stumble upon more and more errors or in programming terms: bugs. It was first coined by U.S. Navy Rear Admiral Grace Hopper when they found a moth inside their computer that caused issues with their calculations.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-8":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-8","title":"Object Oriented Programming","description":"In object orientated programming, the goal is to break a program into objects.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-9":{"id":"turing-tako/intro-to-cs/page-9","title":"Program Efficiency","description":"Even though computers are getting faster every day, efficiency still plays a major factor because datasets that our programs run are growing just as fast. Simple solutions may not scale with large datasets which means the program could take extremely long to run.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-1":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-1","title":"Introduction","description":"Programming is the process of implementing logic to create a program which usually solves a problem. It is a useful skill because we are able to automate repetitive and mundane tasks and focus on the more important tasks which require human intelligence.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-2":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-2","title":"Data","description":"A fundamental aspect of programming is working with data and manipulating it to produce a desired result. In this section, we will look at the different types of data that can be used in a program and how to manipulate it.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-3":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-3","title":"Sequences","description":"Sometimes you want to store a list of values that are related to each other and creating a variable for each one would be excessive, inefficient, and will never be flexible for many needs. This is why we have data structures to organize more complex data and the first example of a data structure is a list. A list holds a sequence of values.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-4":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-4","title":"Control Flow","description":"Sometimes running a program in order from top to bottom is not the best way to go about writing a program. We want to be able to decide what code runs under specific conditions, we want to be able to repeat code so that we don\'t have to write it over and over again. All of these issues are solved by implementing control flow. Control flow are different ways we can control how our program runs allowing us to deviate from the normal top to bottom execution.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-5":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-5","title":"Data Handling","description":"A big part of programming is dealing with data and data can get very complex very quickly. There are many different ways to organize and deal with data. So far lists are the only data structure we have seen but there are many more and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-6":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-6","title":"Objects","description":"So far there have been four basic programming patterns used to design programs. They are sequential code, conditional code (if statement), repetitive code (loops), and the use of store and reuse (functions). For highly complex code, these patterns are not enough. This is where object orientated programming comes in.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/python-basics/page-7":{"id":"turing-tako/python-basics/page-7","title":"Networking","description":"There is a limit to how much data we can get on our own and there is lots of data that can be found online for programs to use. Data can come in many forms and can be used for many different purposes.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/simple-data/page-1":{"id":"turing-tako/simple-data/page-1","title":"Beginner Student Language","description":"The Beginner Student Language (BSL) is a small and simple programming language which forms the core of nearly every other language you will ever use. It is built on top of racket but the design method using BSL can be adapted to fit any other programming language.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/simple-data/page-2":{"id":"turing-tako/simple-data/page-2","title":"How to Design Functions","description":"The how to design functions is a design method built to help with systematic design of functions. With well defined functions using this recipe, it eases the process of solving more complex problems.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/simple-data/page-3":{"id":"turing-tako/simple-data/page-3","title":"How to Design Data","description":"The how to design data is a driving element in many design recipes because many problems involve the manipulation of data. A data definition\'s purpose is to establish the relationship between the information the program needs and the data itself.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"},"turing-tako/turing":{"id":"turing-tako/turing","title":"Computer Science","description":"According to Wikipedia, Computer Science is the study of computation, automation, and information. The ability to be able to use a machine to compute sophisticated problems has advanced mankind\'s knowledge in many folds. We interact with computing devices every with devices like our computers and phones. Everything is sending and relaying information between each other making it a lot more accessible.","sidebar":"turingSidebar"}}}')}}]);
