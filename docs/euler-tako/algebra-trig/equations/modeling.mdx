Many real-world applications can be modeled by linear equations. Things like cell phone packages that charge a monthly service fee plus a charge per minute of talk time, and a car rental company's daily fee plus amount per miles driven.

## Modeling Real World Equations

To set up or model a linear equation to fit a real-world application, we must first determine the known quantities (constants) and define the unknown quantities (variables). After than we can interpret the words as mathematical expressions using mathematical symbols.

> $$\underline{Example}$$
>
> Let's imagine that the cell phone company has a plan that charges $$\$15$$ every month plus $$\$0.02$$ per minute of talk time.
>
> The known quantities are the $$\$15$$ monthly charge and the $$\$0.02/min$$ charge. However, the unknown quantity is the number of minutes of talk time.
>
> In this case the $$\$0.02$$ is multiplied by the unknown quantity so we can express this as $$0.02x$$. The $$\$15$$ is a constant charge every month. The verbal statement says plus so we are adding the charges together.
>
> Assuming $$y$$ is the cost of the bill, this bill can be modeled as $$y = 0.02x + 15$$

Finally, some verbal expressions we can directly translate into math...

| Verbal | Mathematical Translation |
| - | - |
| One number exceeds another by $$a$$ | $$x$$, $$x + a$$ |
| Twice a number | $$2x$$ |
| One number is $$a$$ more than another number | $$x$$, $$x + a$$ |
| One number is $$a$$ less than twice another number | $$x$$, $$2x - a$$ |
| The product of a number and $$a$$, decreased by $$b$$| $$ax - b$$ |
| The quotient of a number and the number plus $$a$$ is three times the number | $$\frac{x}{x + a} = 3x$$ |
| The product of three times a number and the number decreased by $$b$$ is $$c$$ | $$3x(x - b) = c$$ |

## Common Formulas

Some common formulas we encounter solving real world problems include...

1. Area of a rectangular region: $$A = LW$$ where $$L$$ is the length and $$W$$ is the width.
2. Perimeter of a rectangle: $$P = 2L + 2W$$ where $$L$$ is the length and $$W$$ is the width.
3. Volume of a rectangular solid: $$V = LWH$$ where $$L$$ is the length, $$W$$ is the width, and $$H$$ is the height.
