Polynomials enable us to express relationships between constants and indeterminates. These expressions can then be manipulated through various algebraic methods.

## Polynomial Terms

Some important terms include...

1. A **polynomial** is a sum of or difference of terms, each consisting of a variable raised to a nonnegative integer power. This means it is an expression that can be writen in the form $$a_nx^n + ... + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0$$.
2. A **coefficient** is the real number that is multiplied by variable raised to an exponent.
3. A **constant** is a number that is not multiplied by a variable. This technically is the coefficient to $$x^0$$.
4. A **term of a polynomial** is any product term in the polynomial.
5. The **leading term** is the term with highest power.
6. The **leading coefficient** is the coefficient of the leading term.
7. The **degree** of a polynomial is the power of the leading term.

## Types of Polynomials

The types of polynomials include...

1. A **monomial** is a polynomial containing only one term ($$ex.\: 7x^3$$).
2. A **binomial** is a polynomial containing two terms ($$ex.\: 5x + 14$$).
3. A **trinomial** is a polynomial containing three terms ($$ex.\: -9x^2 + 4x - 5$$).

## Manipulating Polynomials

We add and subtract polynomials by combining like terms, which are terms that contain the same variables raised to the same exponents. ($$ex.\: 3x^3$$ and $$-9x^3$$ are like terms but $$3x^2$$ and $$3x^9$$ are not like terms).

To multiply polynomials, we use the distributive property to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial. An example is...

> $$\underline{Example}$$
>
> $$(4x - 1)(2x^2 + 2x + 1)$$
>
> $$4x (2x^2 + 2x + 1) - 1 (2x^2 + 2x + 1)$$ *Use the distribute property*
>
> $$(8x^3 + 8x^2 + 4x)$$ + $$(-2x^2 - 2x - 1)$$ *Multiply*
>
> $$8x^3 + (8x^2 - 2x^2) + (4x - 2x) - 1$$ *Combine like terms*
>
> $$8x^3 + 6x^2 + 2x - 1$$ *Simplify*

## Binomials

The FOIL method is a method we can use to find the product of two binomials. It involves us multiplying the **f**irst terms, the **o**uter terms, the **i**nner terms, and then the **l**ast terms of each binomial. This means $$(ax + b)(cx + d) = acx^2 + adx + bcx + bd$$.

Common binomial products include...

| Name | Definition |
| - | - |
| Perfect Square Trinomials | $$(x + a)^2 = (x + a)(x + a) = x^2 + 2ax + a^2$$ |
| Difference of Squares | $$(a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2$$ |

:::note
A polynomial can contain several variables. An expression like $$3x - 2y + 5$$ is also a polynomial.
