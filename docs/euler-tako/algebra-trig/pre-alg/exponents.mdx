Exponents are algebraic operations that allow us to express extremely large and small numbers. The exponent refers to how many times a number is multiplied by itself.

## Exponent Rules

| \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of Exponents | Definition |
| - | - |
| Product Rule | $$a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}$$ |
| Quotient Rule | $$\frac{a^m}{a^n} = a^{m - n}$$ |
| Power Rule | $$(a^m)^n = a^{m \times n}$$ |
| Zero Exponent Rule | $$a^0 = 1$$ |
| Negative Rule | $$a^{-n} = \frac{1}{a^n}$$ |
| Power of Product Rule | $$(ab)^n = a^nb^n$$ |
| Power of Quotient Rule | $$(\frac{a}{b})^n = \frac{a^n}{b^n}$$ |

## Scientific Notation

We can use **scientific notation** as  shorthand method of writing very small and very large numbers. A number written using this method is in the form $$a \times 10^n$$, where $$1 \leq |a| < 10$$ and $$n$$ is an integer.

The method is to move the decimal point left or right of a given number till only 1 digit is before the decimal point. Count the number of places moved and thats the value of $$n$$ in $$10^n$$. If you moved the decimal to the right, add a negative sign to $$n$$.

To go from scientific to standard, move the decimal $$n$$ places to the right if $$n$$ is positive or $$n$$ places to the left if $$n$$ is negative and add zeros as needed.
