Algebra is the generalization of arithmetic that introduces variables and algebraic operations. This ability to manipulate algebraic structures is relavant to many branches of mathematics and empirical sciences.

## Types of Numbers

| Name | Symbol | Set | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| **Natural Numbers** | $$\mathbb{N}$$ | $$\{1, 2, 3, ...\}$$ | *Counting numbers* |
| **Whole Numbers** | $$\mathbb{W}$$ or $$\mathbb{N_0}$$ | $$\{0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$$ | *Includes zero* |
| **Integers** | $$\mathbb{Z}$$ | $$\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...\}$$ | *Includes negative numbers* |
| **Rational Numbers** | $$\mathbb{Q}$$ | $$\{\frac{m}{n} \mid m$$ and $$n \in \mathbb{Z}$$ and $$n \neq 0 \}$$ | *Can be represented as a fraction* |
| **Irrational Numbers** | $$\mathbb{I}$$ | $$\{h \mid h \notin \mathbb{Q}\}$$ | *Cannot be represented as a fraction* |
| **Real Numbers** | $$\mathbb{R}$$ | $$\mathbb{Q} \cup \mathbb{I}$$ | *Both rational and irrational numbers combined* |

There are various sets that are a subset of another. These include: $\mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{W} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q}$

### Types of Decimals

Fractions when converted into decimals come in two forms...

1. A **terminating decimal** has a defined terminating point ($$ex.\: \frac{15}{8} = 1.875$$).
2. A **repeating decimal** has no terminating point ($$ex.\: \frac{4}{11} = 0.36363636... = 0.\bar{36}$$). A bar is used to denote that those numbers repeat forever.

## Order of Operations

The order is as follows...

1. Paranthesis
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication or Division
4. Addition or Subtraction

## Properties of Real Numbers

| Property | Definition |
| - | - |
| **Commutative Property of Addition** | $$a + b = b + a$$ | 
| **Commutative Property of Multiplication** |$$a \times b = b \times a$$ |
| **Associative Property of Addition** | $$a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c$$ | 
| **Associative Property of Multiplication** | $$a(bc) = (ab)c$$ |
| **Distributive Property** | $$a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$$ |
| **Identity Property of Addition** |  $$a + 0 = a$$ |
| **Identity Property of Multiplication** | $$a \times 1 = a$$ |
| **Inverse Property of Addition** | $$a + (-a) = 0$$ |
| **Inverse Property of Multiplication** | $$a  \times (\frac{1}{a}) = 1$$ |

## Algebraic Terms

These are commonly encountered terms in algebra...
1. A **constant** is a value that does not vary ($$ex.\: 5$$).
2. A **variable** represented a value that can vary and is often represented using an alphabetical letter ($$ex.\: x$$).
3. An **algebraic expression** is a collection of constants and variables joined together by algebraic operations ($$ex.\: x + 5$$).
4. An **equation** is a mathematical statement which indicates that two expressions are equal ($$ex.\: 2x + 1 = 7$$).
5. A **formula** is an equation expressing a relationship between constants and variable quantities ($$ex.\: A = \pi r^2$$ *which is the area of a circle*).
