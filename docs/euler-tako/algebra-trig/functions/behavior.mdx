When we are analyzing functions, we need to have ways to describe the behaviors of said functions. Some common things we use to describe the behavior of functions include the average rate of change, whether it is increasing, decreasing, or constant, and the minimums and maximums found in the function.

## Rate of Change

The **rate of change** describes how an output quantity changes relative to the change in the input quantity. Most time espically with real world data, the rate of change is not constant so we use the **average rate of change** over a specified period of time. The formula for average rate of change is... 

$$\text{Average rate of change}=\frac{\text{Change in output}}{\text{Change in input}} = \frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$$

:::note
The symbol $\Delta$ means the change in a quantity. For example, $\Delta f$ means the change in $f$.

An example of average rate of change is...

> $$\underline{Example}$$
>
> Find the average rate of change of $f(x) = x - 2\sqrt{x}$ on the interval $[1, 9]$.
>
> Let $x_1 = 1$ and $x_2 = 9$
>
> $y_1 = 1 - 2\sqrt{1} = 1 - 2(1) = 1 - 2 = -1$
>
> $y_2 = 9 - 2\sqrt{9} = 9 - 2(3) = 9 - 6 = 3$
>
> $\frac{\Delta{y}}{\Delta{x}} = \frac{3 - (-1)}{9 - 1} = \frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}$
>
> The average rate of change is $\frac{1}{2}$.

:::note
We can use any point to find the slope of a linear line however when we are finding the average rate of change we need to use the points at the endpoints of the interval because we cannot assume that the rate of change is constant.

## Increasing, Decreasing, or Constant

An useful method to describing the behavior of a function is to state if a function is increasing, decreasing, or constant over a given interval.

1. An **increasing function** is a function $f$ on an open interval if $f(b) > f(a)$ for any two input values $a$ and $b$ in a given interval where $b > a$. 
2. A **decreasing function** is a function $f$ on an open interval if $f(b) < f(a)$ for any two input values $a$ and $b$ in the given interval where $b > a$. 
3. A **constant function** is a function $f$ on an open interval if $f(b) = f(a)$ for any two input values $a$ and $b$.

For the most common functions...

| Name | Function | Increasing \ Decreasing |
| - | - | - |
| Constant | $f(x) = c$ | Always constant |
| Identity | $f(x) = x$ | Increasing |
| Quadratic | $f(x) = x^2$ | Increasing on $(0, \infty)$ and Decreasing on $(-\infty, 0)$ |
| Cubic | $f(x) = x^3$ | Increasing |
| Reciprocal | $f(x) = \frac{1}{x}$ | Decreasing $(-\infty, 0) \cup (0, \infty)$ |
| Reciprocal Squared | $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ | Increasing on $(-\infty, 0)$ and Decreasing on $(0, \infty)$ |
| Cube Root | $f(x) = \sqrt[3]{x}$ | Increasing |
| Square Root | $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$ | Increasing on $(0, \infty)$ |
| Absolute Value | $f(x) = \:\mid x \mid$ | Increasing on $(0, \infty)$ and Decreasing on $(-\infty, 0)$ |

## Minimum and Maximum

We use the minimum and maximums of a function to help describe all the peaks and valleys that a function may have and also help us understand where the function changes from increasing to decreasing or decreasing to increasing.

The output of the input where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called the **local minimum**. In other words, the function $f$ has a local minimum at $x = b$ if there exists an interval $(a, c)$ with $a < b < c$ such that, for any $x$ in the interval $(a, c)$, $f(x) \geq f(b)$.

The output of the input where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is called the **local maximum**. In other words, the function $f$ has a local maximum at $x = b$ if there exists an interval $(a, c)$ with $a < b < c$ such that, for any $x$ in the interval $(a, c)$, $f(x) \leq f(b)$.

The **absolute minimum** of $f$ at $x = c$ is $f(c) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

The **absolute maximum** of $f$ at $x = c$ is $f(c) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.
