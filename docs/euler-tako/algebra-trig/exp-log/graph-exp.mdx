Exponential functions are used for many real-world applications in the sciences and business and they give us a method for making predictions. However, being able to make predictions off equations is not always enough. Being able to graph these functions can give us a visual representation of the data which is a powerful tool allowing us to arrive at more insightful conclusions. 

## Graphing

In order to graph exponential functions, we need to be able to graph the parent function $$f(x) = b^x$$ where $$b > 0$$ and $$b \neq 1$$. This parent function has the following characteristics which are useful to note when graphing...
1. It is a one-to-one function
2. There is a horizontal asymptote at $$y = 0$$
3. The domain is $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ and the range is $$(0, \infty)$$
4. There is no $x$-intercept but there is a $y$-intercept at $$(0, 1)$$
5. The graph is increasing if $$b > 1$$ and decreasing if $$b < 1$$

Noting all these properties, we can graph an exponential function of the form $$f(x) = b^x$$ by...
1. Creating a table of points.
2. Plotting at least $3$ points from the table, including the $y$-intercept $(0, 1)$.
3. Drawing a smooth curve through the points.
4. Stating the domain, range, and horizontal asymptote.

> All functions of the form $$f(x) = b^x$$ have the same domain, range, and horizontal asymptote. The domain is $$(-\infty, \infty)$$, the range is $$(0, \infty)$$ and the horizontal asymptote is $$y = 0$$.

:::note
For any exponential function of the form $$f(x) = ab^x$$, we call the base the **constant ratio** because as the input increases by $1$, the output value will be the product of the base and the previous output, regardless of the value of $a$. For example, if $$f(x) = 2^x$$ and $$f(2) = 4$$ then $$f(3) = f(2) * b = 4 * 2 = 8$$. This is useful when creating tables for graphing.

## Transformations

We can take the parent function $$f(x) = b^x$$ and apply transformations to get any exponential function of the form $$f(x) = ab^x$$. This means with the ability to graph the parent function, we can graph any exponential function.

### Vertical Shift

The first transformation occurs when we add a constant $$d$$ to the parent function $$f(x) = b^x$$, giving us $$f(x) = b^x + d$$. This shifts the graph vertically by $$d$$ units in the same direction as the sign of $$d$$.

<Fig src={alg2} caption='Vertical Shift' num={2}/>

When we perform a vertical shift, the new properties are...
1. The domain $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ remains the same.
2. The range is shifted by $$d$$ units and so the new range is $$(d, \infty)$$.
3. The horizontal asymptote shifts by $$d$$ units and so the new asymptote is $$y = d$$.
4. The $y$-intercept shifts by $$d$$ units and so the new $y$-intercept is $$(0, 1 + d)$$.

### Horizontal Shift

The second transformation occurs when we add a constant $$c$$ to the input of the parent function $$f(x) = b^x$$, giving us $$f(x) = b^{x + c}$$. This shifts the graph horizontally by $$c$$ units in the opposite direction of the sign of $$c$$.

<Fig src={alg3} caption='Horizontal Shift' num={3}/>

When we perform a vertical and horizontal shift, we get the equation of the form $$f(x) = b^{x + c} + d$$ where the new properties are...
1. The domain $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ remains the same.
2. The range is shifted by $$d$$ units and so the new range is $$(d, \infty)$$.
3. The horizontal asymptote shifts by $$d$$ units and so the new asymptote is $$y = d$$.
4. The $y$-intercept changes to $$(0, b^c + d)$$. 

### Stretch and Compression

We can also stretch or compress the graph of the parent function by multiplying the parent function by a constant $$a$$, giving us $$f(x) = ab^x$$. If $$|a| > 1$$, the graph is stretched vertically by a factor of $$a$$ and if $$|a| < 1$$, the graph is compressed vertically by a factor of $$a$$.

<Fig src={alg4} caption='Stretch and Compression' num={4}/>

When we perform a stretch or compression, the new properties are...
1. The domain $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ remains the same.
2. The range $$(0, \infty)$$ remains the same.
3. The horizontal asymptote $$y = 0$$ remains the same.
4. The $y$-intercept changes to $$(0, a)$$.

### Reflection

We can also reflect the graph of the parent function about the $x$-axis and the $y$-axis by multiplying the parent function by a negative constant.

To reflect about the $x$-axis, we use the function $$f(x) = -b^x$$ and it has the following properties...
1. The domain $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ remains the same.
2. The range is reflected about the $x$-axis and so the new range is $$(-\infty, 0)$$.
3. The horizontal asymptote is $$y = 0$$ and remains the same.
4. The $y$-intercept is $$(0, -1)$$.

To reflect about the $y$-axis, we use the function $$f(x) = b^{-x} = (\frac{1}{b})^x$$ and the properties stay the same as the parent function. Nothing changes except the graph is reflected about the $y$-axis.

### General Function

A translation of an exponential function has the form $$f(x) = ab^{x + c} + d$$ where the parent function, $$y = b^x$$, $$b > 1$$, is shifted horizontally $$c$$ units to the left, shifted vertically $$d$$ units, stretched vertically by a factor of $$|a|$$ if $$|a| > 0$$, compressed vertically by a factor of $$|a|$$ if $$|a| < 1$$, and reflected about the $x$-axis if $$a < 0$$.

> $$\underline{Example}$$
>
> Write the equation where $$f(x) = e^x$$ is compressed vertically by a factor of $$\frac{1}{3}$$, reflected about the $x$-axis, and then shifted down $2$ units. Graph the function and state the horizontal asymptote, the domain, the range, and the $y$-intercept.
>
> Firstly, the equation is compressed vertically by a factor of $$\frac{1}{3}$$ so $$a = \frac{1}{3}$$. The function is then reflected about the $x$-axis so $$a < 0$$ which means $$a = -\frac{1}{3}$$. Finally, the function is shifted down $$2$$ units so $$d = -2$$. Putting everything together, we get the equation $$f(x) = -\frac{1}{3}e^x - 2$$.

> The horizontal asymptote is $$y = -2$$ because the function is shifted down $2$ units. The domain is $$(-\infty, \infty)$$. Next, the range is $$(-\infty, -2)$$ because the function is shifted down $2$ units and reflected about the $x$-axis. Finally, the $y$-intercept is $$(0, a + d) = (0, -\frac{1}{3} - 2) = (0, -\frac{7}{3})$$ because of the vertical compression and the vertical shift.
