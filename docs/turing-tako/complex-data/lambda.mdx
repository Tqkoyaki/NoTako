We often look for shortcuts we can use in code to make it faster and cleaner to write code and one such shortcut can be found using the `lambda` primitive. This allows us to write simple functions in one expression.

## Uses of Lambda

The syntax for lambda is `(lambda (args ...) (body...))`. The first parameter asks us to state all the parameters needed for this function and body is the expression that uses the parameters stated.

```racket title="Simple Function" showLineNumbers
;; Number (listof Number) -> (listof Number)
;; produce only elements of lon > threshold

(define (only-bigger threshold lon)
  (local [(define (pred n) 
            (> n threshold))]
    (filter pred lon)))
```

We want to use a `lambda` primitive to write the `pred` function which will allow us to remove the `local` argument all together making it easier to read.

```racket title="Lambda Version" showLineNumbers
(define (only-bigger threshold lon)
    (filter (lambda (n) (> n threshold)) lon))
```

As you can see this makes the function a lot cleaner as it only takes two lines. Let's look at one more example where it cleans up code significantly.

```racket title="Quick Sort" showLineNumbers
;; (listof Number)  ->  (listof Number)
;; produce list of numbers sorted in ASCENDING order
;; ASSUMPTION: lon contains no duplicates

(define (qsort lon)
  (if (empty? lon) 
      empty
      (local [(define p (first lon))
              (define (<p? n) (< n p))
              (define (>p? n) (> n p))]
        (append (qsort (filter <p? lon))
                (list p) 
                (qsort (filter >p? lon))))))


;; Lambda Version
(define (qsort lon)
  (if (empty? lon)
      empty
      (append (qsort (filter (lambda (n) (< n (first lon))) lon))
              (list (first lon))
              (qsort (filter (lambda (n) (> n (first lon))) lon)))))
```

## When to Use?

This new primitive is very useful but it should not be used for every situation. `Lambda` should be used when a locally defined function is only used in one place and the body is so easily understood that naming the function doesn't make the code easier to understand.
